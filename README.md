## 1. Requirements
* Create a basic web application using the following technology stack:
* Technology - React with Typescript (https://create-reactapp.dev/docs/addingtypescript/)
* State management - Redux and redux-toolkit
(https://reduxtoolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
* UI Library (optional) - e.g. Antd (https://ant.design/components/overview/)
* Router - react-router (https://reactrouter.com/)
* Backend - JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/)
## 2. Users list
* GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
* GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/:userId
* Use the public JSONPlaceholder API to fetch and display 10 users on the home
page of the application
* Display the users as a vertical list of collapsible sections
* Expanded users should be editable
* Add input validation - username, email, address.street, address.suite, and
address.city are mandatory
* Implement cancel/revert and submit buttons (should only be active when changes
are made)
* Add a button ’See posts’ that redirects to a new page
## 3. User posts
* GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=X
* Display the user details at the top of the page (information should be editable as
on the home page)
* Fetch and display a list of posts for the given user id
* Posts should be editable and deletable through the JSONPlaceholder API - use a
confirmation popup for the delete functionality
## 4. Tasks
* GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
* Create a separate /tasks route
* Fetch and display a list of tasks - use HTML table with pagination of page size 10
* Allow filtering by task status (completed or not completed), title and owner (user)
* Implement functionality for changing the status of a task - changes should persist
through searches
## 5. Notes
* Cover empty, error and loading states
* Aim for a simple but good-looking UI
* Add unit tests
